            Years Old.My strengths are Quick learner, hardworking,
            self-motivating, and also dedicated to my work. My short-term goal
            is to explore and gain technical knowledge. And my long-term goal is
            to achieve a good position where I can build my career as well as an
            organization too. My hobbies are learning something new, poetry and
            crafting. As a fresher, I don't have any work experience, but I will
